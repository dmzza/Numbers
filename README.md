## Show the Script menu in the menu bar
1. In the Script Editor app on your Mac, choose `Script Editor > Preferences`, then click `General`.
2. Select the `Show Script menu in menu bar` checkbox, then make sure the `Show Computer scripts` checkbox is selected.
    - The Script menu appears on the right side of the menu bar.
3. Select `Show application scripts at top`

The next time you need to access a script, just click the Script menu icon in the menu bar, then choose an option.

## Add a script to the Script menu
- In the Script Editor app on your Mac, save your script as a file in the Finder.
- Then copy the file into the Script Editor Scripts folder (located in the Script folder in the users Library folder).
- `/Users/JohnAppleseed/Library/Scripts/Applications/Numbers`

## How to access the Library folder

6. Any scripts copied inside here, will appear in the Script menu drop down when Numbers is running.
